# Xamarin learning / getting started ressources
On this page we focus on training. There are tons of good resources where you can learn about Xamarin:

### ~~Xamarin University~~ -> Microsoft Learn

Former Xamarin University content and new content can now be found (free of charge) on [Microsoft Learn](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/xamarin). 

### Xamarin Dev Days
There is still content from the former dev days with tutorials and slides that can be found [here](https://github.com/xamarin/dev-days-labs). This focuses not only on Xamarin, but also shows how to build a backend with azure.

### App Innovation Workshop
[This workshop](https://github.com/microsoft/app-innovation-workshop) has more focus on azure than on mobile, but it still shows a lot of Xamarin.

### Blogs
A great aggregator of all kinds of blogs is [Planet Xamarin](https://www.planetxamarin.com/) which has a good collection and variety of topics, authors and content. Other than that, these might be worth checking out:
